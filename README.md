# Noughts and Crosses (Tic-Tac-Toe)

This is a project I created by myself as part of the Odin Project with the main objective being to use object contructors to improve the quality of my code. I found this a challenging task but learned plenty from it.

<h4>What I Learned</h4>
<ul>
<li>I feel that I successfully managed to understand how to use object contructors. I learnt their usefulness as well as their limits.</li>
<li>I got a much better understanding of the <i>return</i> function. 
<li>I improved my knowledge of how to use arrays considerably, mainly through trial and error. While frustrating at times, I feel my use of arrays to check the winning conditions saved a lot of lines of code</li>
<li>While not considerable exciting, I am pleased with the simplicity of the design of my project in comparison to the last.</li>

<h4>Mistakes to Learn From</h4>
<ul>
<li>While I feel that my knowledge of how to use object constructors is very good, the nuances of where to put certain objects and functions sometimes confused me.

I think it would be good to have someone to look over my code although I am not sure how realistic an expectation this is at the moment. With some guidance and corrections to my code I feel I would understand this much better</li>
<li>There was one occasion that I couldn't use the return function as I wanted to. I got confused and still do not fully understand what went wrong although I did eventually find a work around when moving variables between objects.

Again having someone to help me would have been good. I will attempt to figure this out again in the future when I have less complicated code as this issue arose around the tail end of my project</li>
<li>I found the game logic very difficult at first and had absolutely no idea what to do. I found the brief instructions on the Odin Project more confusing than helpful at first. To resolve this I looked at some pseudocode explinations of how the game worked as well as using help from stack overflow. While the help was nothing too major I did copy the <i>checker</i> funtion that I used. However I spent time understanding how it works as I was missing the knowledge of how <i>.ever</i> works.

I find games very difficult. They are my least favourite kind of project at the moment. Perhaps this is a sign that I should work on more of these types of projects.</li>

<h4>Furture Improvements</h4>

The game is missing an AI feature that could be implemented in the future. To be honest, this is not something that interests me and therefore I think it will be difficult to find motivation to complete this. The design could be improved too but this was not a key factor in this project. The only improvements I would like to make are in regards to the location of my functions and elements, however, as noted in my <i>Mistakes to Learn From</i> section, this is something I would want guidance with.
